# Dad jokes

A simple front end application built using React. The Dad-Jokes application connects to the icanhazdadjoke API and fetches really cringy dad jokes. 10 Jokes are fetched at a time, and the user can vote and downvote individual jokes. These actions then persist in the localstorage in the browser. User can fetch more fresh jokes with the help of a button.
